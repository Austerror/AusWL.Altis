Austerror Survivor (previously AusWL) is a survival sandbox mission (+ required mods) forked from ArmA3_Wasteland.Altis v0.9g.

This modification changes the gameplay to a pure survival setting. Based on future (or perhaps current) events that see the
Earth nearly 1 year after a virus has wiped out most of the population. The enemy consists of other players (optional), infected
survivors and bandits.

Many new items added. All Wasteland items removed for actual real inventory items.

Feature List: (to be completed).
